Project Overview:
A GPA calculator manages variables for total points and credit hours. It prompts the user for the number of courses, collects grades and credit hours for each, validates input, accumulates credit hours, and computes the GPA based on a grading scale. Finally, it displays the calculated GPA if sufficient data is available
PROJECT IDEA:
A GPA calculator is a tool that helps students calculate their grade point average (GPA). A GPA is a numerical representation of a student's academic performance over time. It is calculated by averaging the grade points that a student has earned in each of their courses. Grade points are assigned to letter grades. The calculator takes input such as course grades and credit hours and then computes the GPA based on a specific grading scale. 
1. Set up variables to track total points and credit hours. 
2. Ask the user for the number of courses. 
3. For each course, get the grade and credit hours. 
4. Validate credit hours and calculate grade points. 
5.Accumulate credit hours. 
6. Calculate GPA if possible and display it

Conclusion: 
This C++ program calculates the GPA (Grade Point Average) of first Semester for a student based on their marks in theoretical and practical subjects. The program consists of three main functions:
getValidCreditHours (): Ensures the user inputs valid credit hours for a subject.
getValidMarks (): Takes input for theory and practical marks, validating them within specified ranges.
getSubjectDetails (int choice): Gathers details for a selected subject, including credit hours, theory, and practical marks. It accumulates total points and credit hours for both theory and practical.
calculateAndDisplayGPA (): Computes GPA for theory and practical courses separately and then calculates an overall GPA. It also displays the corresponding letter grade.
The main function (main ()) serves as the program's entry point, allowing users to input their subject choices iteratively. The program terminates when the user enters '0'. Finally, it calculates and displays the overall GPA and corresponding letter grade based on the accumulated data.
In summary, the program modularly handles input validation, subject details gathering, and GPA calculation, providing a comprehensive tool for assessing academic performance.
